## Introduction

Proof of Origin (PO) Token is a parameter that YouTube requires to be sent with requests from some clients. Without it, requests for the affected clients' format URLs may return HTTP Error 403, or result in your account or IP address being blocked.

A PO Token is generated by an attestation provider on Web, Android and iOS platforms to attest the requests are coming from a genuine client.

For yt-dlp, you can provide PO Token(s) using the [`po_token` extractor argument](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#youtube), or you can [install a plugin](#plugins) that hooks into the YouTube extractor to handle fetching a PO Token.

For more technical details on these tokens, refer to the [technical details section](#technical-details).

## Cases where a PO Token is required

There are currently three cases yt-dlp may require PO Tokens for video downloads, [depending on the client used](#current-po-token-enforcement):
- GVS: Google Video Server requests (video streaming - https, dash, hls, etc.)
- Player: Innertube `player` requests (fetch video format URLs)
- Subs: Subtitle requests

The PO Tokens may be generated differently for each of these cases, depending on the client.

### Current PO Token enforcement

YouTube is at present rolling out changes to enforce PO Tokens for video playback. Currently, only GVS and Subs require PO Tokens for some clients.

| Client         | PO Token Required For       | Notes                                                                                           |
|----------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `web`          | Subs (rolling out), GVS     | Only SABR formats available                                                                     |
| `web_safari`   | Subs (rolling out), GVS*    | Same as `web`. *Provides HLS (m3u8) formats which do not require PO Token for GVS at this time. |
| `mweb`         | GVS                         |                                                                                                 |
| `tv`           | Not required                | All formats may have DRM if you request too much                                                |
| `tv_simply`    | Not required                | Account cookies not supported                                                                   |
| `tv_embedded`  | Not required                | Requires account cookies                                                                        |
| `web_embedded` | Not required                | Only embeddable videos available                                                                |
| `web_music`    | GVS                         |                                                                                                 |
| `web_creator`  | GVS                         | Requires account cookies                                                                        |
| `android`      | GVS or Player               | Account cookies not supported                                                                   |
| `android_vr`   | Not required                | YouTube Kids videos are not available                                                           |
| `ios`          | GVS or Player (rolling out) | Account cookies not supported                                                                   |

For all clients:
- GVS PO Token is not required for YouTube Premium subscribers
- HLS live streams do not require a PO Token (excluding `ios` client)

You can select what client to use with the [`player_client` extractor argument](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#youtube).

## PO Token Provider Plugins

> [!TIP]
> Recommended

Manually fetching PO Tokens can be a tedious process. As an alternative, you can install a PO Token Provider plugin to handle fetching PO Tokens automatically.

### Featured Plugins

- [bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider](https://github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider) by [Brainicism](https://github.com/Brainicism)
  - A PO Token Provider which uses [BgUtils](https://github.com/LuanRT/BgUtils) to generate PO Tokens. _Not affiliated with yt-dlp._

Check out the [yt-dlp-pot-provider GitHub topic](https://github.com/topics/yt-dlp-pot-provider) for more PO Token Provider plugins.

For developers, refer to the [PO Token Provider developer documentation](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/tree/master/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube/pot/README.md)

## Guide: Providing a PO Token manually (for use with `mweb` client)

This section provides a basic guide on extracting PO Token(s) manually from YouTube in a web browser **for use with the `mweb` client**, and manually passing it to yt-dlp via the [`po_token` extractor argument](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#youtube). 
The same PO Token extraction method _may_ work with other web browser-based clients too.

> [!TIP]
> When supplying multiple PO Tokens, use the same extractor args option and comma-separate the PO Token configurations. For example:
>   `--extractor-args "youtube:po_token=mweb.gvs+GVS_PO_TOKEN_VALUE_HERE,mweb.player+PLAYER_PO_TOKEN_VALUE_HERE"`


### PO Token for GVS

The PO Token used for `web` GVS requests is tied to your YouTube session, so you will need to provide cookies.

1. Open **[YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com)** in a browser.
2. Open the developer console (F12), then go to the "Network" tab (click the `>>` button if you don't see it)
3. Filter requests by `v1/player`
4. Play a video - a `player` request should appear in the network tab
5. From the most recent `player` request, extract the PO Token from `serviceIntegrityDimensions.poToken` field in the JSON request body
6. Pass the PO Token for GVS to yt-dlp using `--extractor-args "youtube:player-client=default,mweb;po_token=mweb.gvs+PO_TOKEN_VALUE_HERE"` with cookies (`--cookies COOKIES_FILE` or `--cookies-from-browser`)

If using an account, [refer to this guide on exporting account cookies](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#exporting-youtube-cookies)

(Not recommended) If not using an account, you may also provide visitor data instead of cookies. Refer to [Passing Visitor Data without cookies](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#passing-visitor-data-without-cookies).

### PO Token for Player or Subs

The PO Token for `web`/`mweb` Player or Subs requests is tied to the Video ID. This means you must generate a new PO Token for each video.

1. Open **[YouTube Web](https://www.youtube.com)** in a browser.
2. Open the developer console (F12), then go to the "Network" tab and filter by `v1/player`
3. Navigate to the video you want to download (e.g. using search - do not go to the video url directly as the page will refresh)
4. In the request payload JSON, find the PO Token at `serviceIntegrityDimensions.poToken` and save that value
5. Export cookies from the browser

**For Subs PO Token:**
- Pass the PO Token for Subs to yt-dlp using `--extractor-args "youtube:po_token=web.subs+PO_TOKEN_VALUE_HERE"`

**For Player PO Token:**
> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the `web` client and have not disabled the `webpage` request, providing this PO Token is not necessary at this time. 

- Pass the PO Token for Player to yt-dlp using `--extractor-args "youtube:player-client=default,mweb;po_token=mweb.player+PO_TOKEN_VALUE_HERE"`

## Technical details

PO Tokens are still an active area of research, and at the same time YouTube is continuously updating the implementation and enforcement. The following information is based on the current understanding of PO Tokens, and is subject to change.

A PO Token is generated by either BotGuard (Web), DroidGuard (Android), iOSGuard (iOS). A PO Token from one platform cannot be used on another (i.e., Web PO Token cannot be used on Android or iOS).

If you are interested, we recommend checking out the [BgUtils](https://github.com/LuanRT/BgUtils) project which does a deeper dive into the BotGuard attestation process.

### PO Tokens for GVS

GVS uses a PO token bound to the user session.

For Web session tokens:
- When logged out, are bound to a Visitor ID. This Visitor ID is found in the `VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE` cookie, in the `visitorData` value which is sent with Innertube API requests, or with `ytcfg.get('VISITOR_DATA')` in the browser console.
- When logged in, are bound to the account Session ID (first part of the Data Sync ID). This can be found at `responseContext.mainAppWebResponseContext.dataSyncId` in Innertube responses, or with `ytcfg.get('DATASYNC_ID')` in the browser console.

If a video download fails with an HTTP 403 midway through, then the client likely requires a PO Token for GVS.

These PO Tokens are only valid for a limited time (usually at least 12 hours), so it will need to be refreshed periodically. However, some reports suggest that the token may be valid for many days.

### PO Tokens for Player and Subs

Web Tokens for player (and subtitles) requests are bound to the video ID the associated `/player` request is for. YouTube has only recently started generating these for some clients (e.g. `web`).

As of writing, some clients, such as `web_music` use a session-bound PO Token for player requests. This is likely to change.

For Android (and presumably iOS), the Player PO Token is bound to the user session, similar to GVS tokens. If a Player PO token is provided, the GVS PO token is not required.
