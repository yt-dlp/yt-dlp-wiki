Proof of Origin (PO) Token is a parameter that YouTube requires to be sent with requests from some clients. Without it, requests for the affected clients' format URLs may return HTTP Error 403, or result in your account or IP address being blocked.

For yt-dlp, you can provide PO Token(s) using the [`po_token` extractor argument](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#youtube), or you can install a plugin that hooks into the YouTube extractor to handle fetching a PO Token.

### Background

A PO Token is generated by an attestation provider on Web, Android and iOS platforms to attest the requests are coming from a genuine client.

There are currently two cases yt-dlp may require PO Tokens for video downloads, depending on the client used:
- GVS: Google Video Server requests, which use a PO Token bound to the user session.
- Player: Innertube `player` requests, which use a PO Token bound to the video ID.

These may not be interchangeable, and you will need to provide both if you are using a client that requires both.

For more technical details on these tokens, refer to the [technical details section](#technical-details).

## Current PO Token enforcement

YouTube is at present rolling out changes to enforce PO Tokens for video playback. Currently, only GVS requires PO Tokens for some clients.

| Client         | PO Token for GVS Required | PO Token for Player Required | Notes                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `web`          | Yes                       | No                           |                                       |
| `web_safari`   | Yes*                      | No                           |                                       |
| `mweb`         | Yes                       | No                           |                                       |
| `tv`           | No                        | No                           |                                       |
| `tv_embedded`  | No                        | No                           | Requires account cookies              |
| `web_embedded` | No                        | No                           |                                       |

*Client provides HLS (m3u8) formats which do not require PO Token for GVS at this time.

You can select what client to use with the [`player_client` extractor argument](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#youtube).

## Providing a PO Token manually (for web client)

This section provides a basic guide on extracting PO Token(s) manually from YouTube in a web browser **for use with the `web` client**, and manually passing it to yt-dlp via the [`po_token` extractor argument](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#youtube). The same PO Token extraction method may work with other web browser-based clients too.

> [!TIP]
> When supplying multiple PO Tokens, use the same extractor args option and comma-separate the PO Token configurations. For example:
>   `--extractor-args "youtube:po_token=web.gvs+GVS_PO_TOKEN_VALUE_HERE,web.player+PLAYER_PO_TOKEN_VALUE_HERE"`


### PO Token for GVS

The PO Token used for `web` GVS requests is tied to your YouTube session. It generated differently depending on if you are logged in to yt-dlp or not.

#### No account

1. Open [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com) or YouTube Embedded (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqz-KE-bpKQ) in a browser.  **Make sure you are not logged in to any account!**
2. Open any video
3. Open the developer console (F12), then go to the "Network" tab and filter by `googlevideo`
4. Click the video and play for a few seconds - requests to `googlevideo.com` should appear in the network tab
5. From the most recent `googlevideo.com` request, extract the `pot` query parameter value from the URL
6. Pass the PO Token for GVS to yt-dlp using `--extractor-args "youtube:po_token=web.gvs+PO_TOKEN_VALUE_HERE"` with cookies (`--cookies COOKIES_FILE` or `--cookies-from-browser`)

Although not recommended, you may also provide visitor data instead of cookies. Refer to [Passing Visitor Data without cookies](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#passing-visitor-data-without-cookies).

#### With an account

1. Open [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com) in a browser, and log in with the user you are using with yt-dlp
2. Open any video
3. Follow steps 3-5 above
4. Pass the PO Token for GVS to yt-dlp using `--extractor-args "youtube:po_token=web.gvs+PO_TOKEN_VALUE_HERE"` [with your account cookies ](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#exporting-youtube-cookies)

Addendum:
- If there is no `pot` parameter in the `googlevideo.com` URL, wait a few seconds for more requests to be made and check them. 
- If there is a `sabr=1` query parameter in the `googlevideo.com` URL, then the PO Token is in the request body protobuf (and therefore is not easy to extract). 
  - This should not be the case for YouTube Music or YouTube Embedded - if so, please raise an issue so we can update these docs.


### PO Token for Player

The PO Token for `web` Player requests is tied to the Video ID. This means you must generate a new PO Token for each video.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the `web` client and have not disabled the `webpage` request, providing this PO Token is not necessary.

1. Open [YouTube Web](https://www.youtube.com) in a browser.
2. Open the developer console (F12), then go to the "Network" tab and filter by `v1/player`
3. Navigate to the video you want to download (e.g. using search - do not go to the video url directly as the page will refresh)
4. In the request payload JSON, find the PO Token at `serviceIntegrityDimensions.poToken` and save that value
5. Export cookies from the browser
6. Pass the PO Token for Player to yt-dlp using `--extractor-args "youtube:po_token=web.player+PO_TOKEN_VALUE_HERE"`

## Plugins

Manually fetching PO Tokens can be a tedious process. Alternatively, you can use a plugin that hooks into the YouTube extractor to handle fetching a PO Token.

  - An experimental plugin framework for yt-dlp to support fetching PO Tokens from external providers. _Maintained by a yt-dlp maintainer._

  - A [yt-dlp-get-pot](https://github.com/coletdjnz/yt-dlp-get-pot) provider which uses [BgUtils](https://github.com/LuanRT/BgUtils) to generate PO Tokens. _Not affiliated with yt-dlp._

See the [yt-dlp-plugins GitHub topic](https://github.com/topics/yt-dlp-plugins) and the [yt-dlp plugin wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Plugins) to explore more yt-dlp plugins.

## Technical details

PO Tokens are still an active area of research, and at the same time YouTube is continuously updating the implementation and enforcement. The following information is based on the current understanding of PO Tokens, and is subject to change.

A PO Token is generated by either BotGuard (WebPO), DroidGuard (Android), iOSGuard (iOS). A PO Token from one platform cannot be used on another (i.e., WebPO Token cannot be used on Android or iOS).

If you are interested, we recommend checking out the [BgUtils](https://github.com/LuanRT/BgUtils) project which does a deeper dive into the BotGuard attestation process.

### PO Tokens for GVS

GVS uses a PO token bound to the user session.

For WebPO session tokens:
- When logged out, are bound to a Visitor ID. This Visitor ID is found in the `VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE` cookie, in the `visitorData` value which is sent with Innertube API requests, or with `ytcfg.get('VISITOR_DATA')` in the browser console.
- When logged in, are bound to the account Session ID (first part of the Data Sync ID). This can be found at `responseContext.mainAppWebResponseContext.dataSyncId` in Innertube responses, or with `ytcfg.get('DATASYNC_ID')` in the browser console.

If a video download fails with an HTTP 403 midway through, then the client likely requires a PO Token for GVS.

These PO Tokens are only valid for a limited time (usually at least 12 hours), so it will need to be refreshed periodically. However, some reports suggest that the token may be valid for many days.

### PO Tokens for Player

WebPO Tokens for player requests are bound to the video ID the associated `/player` request is for. YouTube has only recently started generating these for some clients (e.g. `web`).

As of writing, some clients, such as `web_music` use a session-bound PO Token for player requests. This is likely to change.
